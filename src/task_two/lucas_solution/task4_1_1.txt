Task 4.1 Part 1.1 Report

First of all bandwidth memory benchmark measure the maximum achievable memory data transfer bandwidth.

Some memory bandwidth benchmarking tools are:
- AIDA64
-- Description: AIDA64 is a comprehensive system diagnostic and benchmarking tool that provides detailed information about various aspects of a computer's hardware and software. AIDA64 is the successor for AIDA32 and EVEREST.
-- Memory Benchmarking Feature: AIDA64 includes a memory benchmarking tool that measures memory read, write, and copy speeds. It also provides latency measurements.

- PassMark PerformanceTest
-- Description: PerformanceTest is a benchmarking tool suite that covers various aspects of system performance, including CPU, GPU, disk, and memory.
-- Memory Benchmarking Feature: It includes a memory benchmarking test that measures memory bandwidth, latency, and throughput.

- SiSoftware Sandra
-- Description: Sandra is a system diagnostic and benchmarking tool that offers a wide range of tests for various hardware components. It works similar to AIDA32 or EVEREST.
-- Memory Benchmarking Feature: Sandra includes a memory benchmarking module that tests both bandwidth and latency of different memory operations.

- Geekbench
-- Description: Geekbench is a cross-platform benchmarking tool that assesses both CPU and memory performance.
-- Memory Benchmarking Feature: It includes a memory benchmark that measures memory read and write speeds, along with latency.


Some memory bandwidth benchmarking methods are:
- Sequential Read/Write
-- Description: This method involves reading or writing data in a continuous, sequential manner.
-- Purpose: It measures the maximum data transfer rate during sustained, sequential operations. This is crucial for tasks like video editing, file copying, and other operations that involve large files.

- Random Read/Write
-- Description: In this method, data is accessed at random locations in memory rather than sequentially.
-- Purpose: It assesses how well the memory performs when accessing data in a non-linear fashion. This is important for tasks involving small, random accesses, such as database operations.

- Latency Testing
-- Description: Latency is the time it takes for a request for data to be fulfilled. It measures the delay between the request and the actual delivery of the data.
-- Purpose: Low latency is critical for tasks that require rapid response times, such as gaming, real-time simulations, and some scientific computing applications.

- Cache Hierarchy Testing
-- Description: Some benchmarking tools provide insights into the performance of different levels of cache memory, including L1, L2, and L3 caches.
-- Purpose: Understanding cache performance helps in optimizing algorithms and code for specific memory hierarchies.

- Multi-Threaded Testing
-- Description: This method evaluates memory performance under the conditions of multiple simultaneous read and write operations.
-- Purpose: It's relevant for multi-threaded applications that require fast access to various data sets concurrently. This helps assess how well memory handles parallel processing.
